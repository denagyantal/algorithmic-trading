# algorithmic-trading

GOAL:
- If the alg can beat the buy and hold strategies, maybe it worth it.
- There are a many well known processes and strategies for delivering high returns, i.e. covered calls, long-short, swing trades. (Algo trading is just the process of using quant and non quant decision making rules to act on investment decisions)


QA:
buy and hold strategy vs super large hedge founds, with pro quants.
Is there a middle ground where I can do more with my trading app?

Is my time invest in it worth it? (besides the learning)
- If I want to be invest in the further, the learning curve can increase my later investment skill, portfolio,etc
What if i just simplify this and try to build something which a helper for buy and hold?
-> maybe if I want to be a quant is it worth it, Do I?


How to decide if it is bull or bear?
 - it sends me an sms that the market reached the bull period, so it is worth to buy something
